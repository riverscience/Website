and Sustainability at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Originally from Maine, she
moved with her family to Oregon as a teenager and immediately fell in love with the rivers,
forests, and mountains of the Pacific Northwest. She earned her Ph.D. in Geography from the
University of Oregon in 2014, with her dissertation research focusing on impacts of climate
change on the hydrology and geomorphology of snowmelt-dominated rivers. Her greatest
passion is hiking and outdoor adventure, both close to home and all over the world. She has
traveled and hiked on six continents.

finished his Master&#39;s degree at Stephen F. Austin State University while running the Outdoor
Recreation Program as a graduate assistant. He then became a field instructor for the National
Outdoor Leadership School, leading extended expeditions in Alaska, Wyoming, and Idaho.
Nathan served as the Coordinator for Iowa State University Outdoor Recreation Program, and
Head of Outdoor Education at the Wooodstock School in the Indian Himalayas where his
certifications from the A.M.G.A.(American Mountain Guide Association) as a Single Pitch
Instructor, Leave No Trace Master Educator and his WMI Wilderness First Responder
certification allowed him to teach and impact students in the field of outdoor education and
recreation in a positive manner for themselves and their environment. Nathan now works as the
Assistant Director of Outdoor Recreation for UNCG in the Kaplan Center and is working on his
Ph.D. in Geography with a focus on Environmental Sustainability. Nathan has traveled around
the world multiple times both on personal trips and while leading students into the outdoors and
loves introducing students how to live outside sustainably. 
Nathan&#39;s research is focused on the visibility of climate change in the Gangotri Glacier and
Ganges headwaters and the subsequent effects on the Hindu pilgrimage to that area. 
When not working, Nathan lives on a small farm outside of Greensboro where he grows and
raises most of his food in a sustainable manner. When not tending to the farm he enjoys whatever
outdoor activity that is best for the season: skiing, sailing, backpacking, running trails, rock
climbing, or paddling trips with his German Shorthair pointer, Miss Kitty.
