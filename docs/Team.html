<p><strong>Jamie Watkins:</strong> Jamie is currently wrapping up her Master of Science in Environment and Sustainability. Jamie’s childhood family vacations were mostly camping trips to the Blue Ridge Parkway. These experiences ingrained in her a lifelong love of the outdoors and a profound sense of responsibility for stewardship of the environment. In 2016 Jamie decided to go back to college and get the bachelor’s degree she had always regretted not having. After a 10-year career in massage therapy, Jamie closed her practice and enrolled at Rowan Cabarrus Community College where she got her associate degree. While she was enrolled at RCCC, Jamie became a Volunteer Hunter Education Instructor for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and a certified Environmental Educator through the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. In 2018 Jamie realized that if she was going to lead children on outdoor adventures, she needed to have some top-notch first aid skills. A NOLS Wilderness First Aid class became her gateway into EMS and Search and Rescue. Jamie joined the Rowan County Rescue Squad in January of 2019 and has since become an Advanced EMT, certified Technical Rescuer, and Land Search Field Team Member. Jamie’s love of the outdoors, passion for EMS, and interest in water quality protection all come together in her thesis research. Jamie is investigating a series of rainfall events that placed a significant burden on Fire, Rescue, and EMS in Rowan County in the years 2018 and 2020. She hopes to use her findings to inform infrastructure management and emergency preplanning measures in Rowan County. Jamie has recently moved back to Gaston County and is serving the City of Lowell, NC as the new Stormwater Administrator. Jamie is working to create a citizen science program to educate Lowell families about the importance of stormwater good housekeeping practices and their impacts on water quality in the South Fork River</p>

His thesis research focused on remote-sensing classification of flooding on North Carolina’s Neuse River from hurricanes Floyd, Matthew, and Florence. He is now working with the USDA Natural Resources Conservations Service’s East Remote Sensing Lab in Greensboro, about 3.7 miles from the Graham building where the GES department is housed. In this position, he is mapping and georeferencing high-resolution images of conservation territory, wetlands, and farmlands in the eastern US. The lab works directly with the USDA and other agencies to provide data and imagery as requested.</p>
